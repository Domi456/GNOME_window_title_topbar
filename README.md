# Window title text on top bar for Gnome

<p>
  I use Pop!_OS, that has Gnome 42.9, and I couldn't find the extension I needed. I mean I found, but it wasn't compatible with my Gnome, so here we are.
  Of course, it's not Pop!_OS exclusive, modifying the metadata.json can make it accessible for any Gnome version.
